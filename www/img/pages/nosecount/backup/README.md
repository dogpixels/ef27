Nosecounter â€“ Counting *all* the Noses
======================================

Based on SVGGraph and written for the API provided by the Regsys of Eurofurence (https://eurofurence.org),
this visualisation brings to you all the numbers in all the shiny ways.

Since I am always open for suggestions and feedback, please feel free to open an issue on this project anytime. (:

This is currently still a work in progress, the initial state of which has been hacked together in little over one day,
so there will most likely still be a _lot_ of space for future improvements. Stay tuned!
