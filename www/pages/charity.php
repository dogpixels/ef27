		<h3>An endangered species</h3>
		<img src="img/pages/charity/cheetahbaby.jpg" alt="cheetah baby" />
		<p>The cheetah is the world's fastest land animal and they are dangerously close to extinction. Less than 7000 of the big cats remain in the wild. The Cheetah Preservation Foundation was founded in 1988, with the principal aim of ensuring the survival of the cheetah and other endangered species.<br/><br/>
		For over 28 years the organisation has worked tirelessly for the conservation of cheetah and other endangered species – they are one of the 5 biggest cheetah centres in the world and have for many years had the highest survival rate of cubs produced globally.

		<h3>Dedicated work</h3>
		<img src="img/pages/charity/lex.jpg" alt="Cheetah 'Lex'" />
		<p>The Cheetah Preservation Foundation (CPF) has crafted a unique program where their visitors have the opportunity to meet some of their ambassador animals. "It is our strong belief that when a person has a close educational experience with an animal, it instils a desire to protect the species and encourages a movement to be more mindful about the exploitation of their environment".<br/><br/>
		The conservation and education facility doesn‘t receive government funding, which is an enormous challenge with the overheads that they face. In addition to their mission, their primary focus is to ensure that all their animals receive the highest attainable standards of medical care and premium species specific diets. Their standards are exceptionally high and it all comes at a cost, as do the many hours of labour put in by our over 100 dedicated and animal loving staff.</p>
