<section class="uk-column-1-2@l">
	<p>Once a humanitarian movement devoted to fighting animal exploitation in circuses, everything changed on that dreadful day: the 24th of February 2022 when Russia attacked Ukraine. Ever since, they have been actively helping animals within war zones. Evacuating, providing food and medicines for shelters, or rebuilding them when they are affected by Russian aggression.</p>

	<p>We at Eurofurence are proud to announce this year’s charity: <strong>UAnimals</strong></p>

	<p>Before the war, they managed to organize the biggest animals rights rally in Eastern Europe. Annually tens of thousands passionate Ukrainians come together in 30 different cities, marching for animal rights.</p>

	<p>During the ongoing war, the same passion and devotion is shown for those who cannot fend for themselves. But their vision does not end there. After the war, they intend to continue their efforts. Like working together with Ukrainian clothes brands, establishing “Cruelty Free Fashion” complete with Best Fashion Awards to celebrate the most ethical designers.</p>

	<p>They even initiated an interfactional union “Humane State” in the Ukrainian parliament to popularize humane values and protect animals from cruelty.</p>

	<p>All these past achievements and future plans show that UAnimals has the passion, the backing and the drive to make sure animals are their top priority during this dreadful war, and the fact they never lose sight of their future goals. But right now, more than ever, they need our help.</p>

	<p>UAnimals is working together with Natalia Popova on a Wild Animals Rescue Center, providing temporary shelter and medical treatment for exotic animals, often rescued from the most troublesome spots in Donetsk and Luhansk. Before the war, these exotic animals were held privately, often in small cages, or in zoos. But during the war they found themselves abandoned, alone between explosions. UAnimals is often asked by military personnel to evacuate these helpless predators. The intensity of these rescue missions is perfectly summarized by one of the members of the evacuation team, Olena Bila:</p>

	<p class="uk-text-italic">“Something is flying towards us, we hear a whistle and think ‘this is it.’ Then it explodes somewhere very close by, but we keep loading the lion into the car”</p>

	<p>With the incoming donations, Wild Animals Rescue Center is planning to build a complex of 10 open air enclosures especially designed for various wild cats. Currently there are 36 animals within the center, including 11 lions, 3 tigers and a leopard. But during their existence they have taken care of 600 animals, not just limited to big cats, like monkeys, deer, elk, horses, foxes, raccoons, hyenas and more.</p>

	<p>But their devotion does not stop there. UAnimals is working hard to call on states, international organizations, and institutions to stop the ecocide in Ukraine. Because besides countless of animals, during the war the unique eco-system of Ukraine is being damages beyond belief. The mass description of animal and plant life, pollution of air and water resources will have lasting consequences thus direct efforts to the preservation and post-war restoration will be a cause worth fighting for.</p>
