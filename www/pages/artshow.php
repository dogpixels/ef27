    <p>Please note that the <a href="artshow/signup">artist rules and the signup process</a> have <strong>changed</strong> for 2023. Some of these changes are due to time and space limitations, some are trials for improving our processes.

      <h2 id="as-artist-rules">Artist Rules</h2>
      
      <p>Here are the full rules for the show. Yes, some of them are rather strict. We're sorry, but there are legal considerations that govern some of them. We'll do our best to accommodate you nonetheless.</p>

      <p>This chapter will provide you with all the information that has not been covered by the <a href="#as-artist-signup">signup</a> or the <a href="#as-artist-rules">rules</a> section. What does the Art Show look like? What are the panel sizes? How will art be hung on the panel? Photos are available to answer your questions. Prepare your art for hanging &ndash; in a way that it does not easily fall down and get damaged.</p>
