<h1>Notice</h1>

<p>Due to unforeseen circumstances, we need to change our venue and date in 2023. We fully understand that this means an inconvenience for those of you who have already made plans and we apologise for that. It was a choice made with the confidence that it will be best for EF in the long run, but we can assure everyone that the choice was not made lightly.</p>
<p>We are going to announce detailed information ASAP.</p> 
<p>We will open a new chapter for Eurofurence so you can continue to enjoy all EF has to offer and we look forward to writing it with you.</p>
