			<p>Since Berlin is a rather large city with many long-distance stations, there are a number of options depending on where your train comes from.</p>
			<p>Despite most trains calling at the central station Berlin Hauptbahnhof, this is most likely not what you want - as it'd take you a good 45 minutes to get to the hotel from there.</p>
			<p>Berlin has a ring railway around the city centre; long distance trains will usually also stop at one of the outlying stations as well. Check your schedule for details.</p>

			<p>From all stations, you need to get on either the <b>S41 Ring ↻</b> or the <b>S42 Ring ↺</b> trains and get off at <i>Sonnenallee</i>. All tickets bearing the destination "BERLIN" are valid for the journey to <i>Sonnenallee</i>.</p>
			<p>
				Long-distance stations are:

	<p>Berlin has two international airports, Tegel (TXL) and Schönefeld (SXF). The existence of a third, larger airport called BER is purely in the hallucinating mind of the Mayor of Berlin.<br/>
	Currently, TXL is taking most of the load. In fact, TXL is overloaded - so be prepared for queues, and bring some extra time. SXF isn't as bad, but it's still rather inadequate for the amounts of passengers it's handling.</p>

		<h3><a id="txl"></a>Tegel Airport (TXL)</h3>
		<p><a href="img/pages/hotel.travel/txl.jpg" rel="lightbox"><img class="colimg" src="img/pages/hotel.travel/txl_small.jpg" alt="TXL map" /></a></p>
		<p><a href="http://www.berlin-airport.de/de/_dokumente/reisende/2015-09-29-txl-anfahrt-und-parken-de-en.pdf" target="_blank">TXL area map, original file as PDF</a></p>
		<p>TXL is a purpose-built airport for the former West Berlin, and is on the Western side of West Berlin, whilst the Estrel is on the Eastern side of West Berlin &mdash; you get the idea, it's a trek across most of the densely populated areas of the city. A taxi from the airport to the Estrel Hotel would typically cost you anywhere between €30 and €50, depending on traffic, the type of taxi, TXL surcharge… and you'll have to deal with Berlin taxi drivers.</p>
		<p>However, there are other, more pleasant options:</p>
		<p>TXL has a direct bus to Berlin city centre, appropriately called "TXL". To go to the Estrel Hotel, you require a Zone 'Berlin AB' ticket, which is €2.80 in 2017.</p>
		</p>

		<p><a href="http://www.bvg.de/de/standortplan/9003201" target="_blank">Main Station connection map, original file as PDF</a></p>
		<p>Get off the TXL bus at Washington&shy;platz/<wbr />Haupt&shy;bahnhof - you are now at position #6 in the map above. Cross the station, take exit Europaplatz and cross the street. On the other side, you will reach bus stop #3 for the M41 metrobus. This bus runs every 10 minutes and terminates at the central station, so there usually should be one waiting for you.</p>
		<p>Stay on the M41 until <i>Ziegrastraße</i>. This is going to take another 25 to 30 minutes.</p>
		<p>Total travel time with the TXL/M41 buses is about 1h10 to about 1h30, depending on traffic conditions, which may vary during the day.</p>
		<p>…we told you it was a trek through the whole city, didn't we?</p>

		<h3><a id="sxf"></a>Sch&ouml;nefeld Airport (SXF)</h3>
		<p>SXF airport is located in the Southeast, just outside Berlin city limits. While it is closer to the Estrel Hotel than TXL, it also has fewer flights - mainly budget airlines and connections to Eastern European countries.</p>
		<p><a href="img/pages/hotel.travel/sxf.jpg" rel="lightbox"><img src="img/pages/hotel.travel/sxf_small.jpg" class="colimg" alt="SXF map" /></a></p>

		<p>
			From Schönefeld airport, you can either take a taxi (about €20 to €25) or use the following two trains:
			<ul>
				<li><b>S9</b> - leave at <i>Treptower Park</i> and change to the <b>S41 Ring ↻</b> and get off at the next stop <i>Sonnenallee</i></li>
				<li><b>S45</b> - leave at <i>Neukölln</i> and change to the <b>S42 Ring ↺</b> and get off at the next stop <i>Sonnenallee</i></li>
			</ul>
			This journey requires a 'Berlin ABC' ticket which is €3.40 as of 2017.
		</p>
		<p>	Do not take any of the RB or RE trains, as these will bring you to destinations further away, and getting back to the hotel from there will be a nuisance.</p>

		<p>Our hotel is not inside an environmental zone, so an environment sticker is not neccessary. However, Berlin's environmental zone starts just across the bridge from the hotel, so if you want to go anywhere in the city centre it's still recommended to get one.</p>
		<p>The Estrel Hotel is located near the junction Grenzallee/AD Neukölln of A100 and A113.</p>
