			<p>The Estrel Hotel Berlin is the biggest convention center and hotel in Europe. Home to 1,125 comfortable rooms and luxury suites, the Estrel offers us all the convention space we need and then some. Arriving at the hotel you enter through the spacious lobby which makes you feel right at home. The lobby has plenty of space to lounge around, meet up with friends, have a drink or just enjoy all the fursuits passing by. The Estrel has everything you need located within the hotel and convention center so that you’ll never need to stray far from the action.</p>
			<p>Directly connected to the hotel is the Estrel convention center. Are you worried EF will run out of space? Worry not! This convention center features a main hall that alone will host 6000 people comfortably. In addition to the main hall, the Estrel has 60 more convention rooms for a grand total of 15,000 m² convention space. Each convention room features all the latest techniques and climate control so it’ll be no problem to attend events in fursuit. As if all of this wasn’t enough space, the hotel also connects to the Estrel Festival Center which hosts daily live shows.</p>

	<p>All of this not enough for you? Want to get away from all the furry action for a bit? There's plenty to do around the hotel!</p>
	<p>A short 400 meter walk away there is a Netto supermarket and a number of restaurants. Just 2 kilometers away from the hotel, you'll be able to enjoy 89 hectares of forest at the "Plänterwald" if you just want to get away from it all. Of course, the concierge team at the Estrel is happy to provide tips on all the things to see and do in Berlin. If you wish to go sightseeing, they'll be the ones to tell you what to see and how to get there.</p>
