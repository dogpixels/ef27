<h1>Glympse Interactive Map</h1>
<section>
	<p>Watch other attendees travel towards Eurofurence (or back)!</p> All you'll need to participate is a smart phone and the <a href="http://glympse.com/get-glympse" target="_blank">Glympse app</a>.</p>
	<p>Simply start the app and set it up to share you location using "!Eurofurence" as a tag.</p>

	<br />

	<iframe id="glympser" width="800" height="600" src="//glympse.com/ext/!eurofurence?twt=Eurofurence&hash=ef23" scrolling="no" marginheight="0" marginwidth="0" frameborder="0"></iframe>
	<!--<button id="full-glympser" onclick="fullglympse()">Open Fullscreen View</button>-->

	<h3>Some Advices</h3>
	<ul>
		<li>If you don't want to share your home address, you might want to enable location sharing a bit after getting on your way to the con.</li>
		<li>Please mind battery load and the rather heavy energy consumption of GPS and Glympse. Make sure your battery is loaded, or others won't see you on the map!</li>
		<li>Although Glympse has a navigation feature, we suggest sticking to the navigation app you've grown used to.</li>
		<li>Please be aware that Glympse is a free third-party service on their own. You agree to their terms and conditions when sharing your location.</li>
		<li>You should be able to watch the !Eurofurence tagged map in the Glympse app. However, this seems to bug out sometimes - in such case, just let the app share your location in the background and watch the map on this website.</p>
		<li>In case of trouble, ... we cannot do anything for you. Sorry, but our entire staff is on their way to the con themselves! ;)</li>
