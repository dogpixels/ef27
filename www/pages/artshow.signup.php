<h1>Art Show &ndash; Artist Signup</h1>
<section>
	<h2>Participation and Invitation</h2>
	
    <p>Traditionally, Eurofurence sends out invitations to artists who may be interested in participating 
    and/or who had participated before. However, getting an invitation is not a requirement. If you 
    think your art deserves a space in the Art Show, please apply for a panel in the show.</p>
</section>

<hr />

<h2>Requirement</h2>
<section class="uk-column-1-2@l">
	<p>There are no official minimum quality requirements for artwork, but due to the limited
	panel space, <strong>the Art Show managers may restrict the number of panels that are allocated to you</strong>.
	You are requested to provide example art and if possible a public gallery in the application.
	If you're a newcomer to an art show, we recommend that you have a good hard look at your art, and 
	decide whether it is of suitable quality to be displayed in the show. The Art Show is no actual 
	contest, but you will inevitably be measured up against other artists by the con's patrons.<br />The emphasis of the Art Show is on art that you created yourself, not just happen to own. If you 
	want to display artwork from others, contact the Art Show managers beforehand for advice. While in certain 
	situations or for certain art pieces this may be permitted, showing others' art should be very limited. 
	The show is not a display for sales of leftover purchases.</p>

	<p>Of course you can act as an agent for artists who are not able to attend, or appoint an agent who will 
	display your artwork for you. For more information, see below.</p>

	<p>If you are in doubt regarding your participation or the suitability of your artwork, don't hesitate 
	to ask the Art Show managers.</p>

<h2>The Exhibiting Process</h2>
<section>
	<p>The Eurofurence Art Show is handling hundreds of art pieces by a score of artists. To perform
	our service in an efficient manner, we need to keep to a standard process, which on the artist's
	side involves the following steps:</p>
	<ul>
	  <li>Information: You read through the signup documentation, the rules, and the guide which will
	  cover most of your questions. If you have any special needs, or find an open question, you may
	  ask the Art Show team at any time for clarification.</li>
	  <li>Signup: You apply for the Art Show by mail, and thereby register. You will need to tell us
	  how many panels and tables you need, and what your age rating is for each of those.</li>
	  <li>Deadline: You need to have applied by the deadline, which is <em><strong>March 31st</strong></em>.</li>
	  <li>Panel distribution: After the deadline, we will look at the numbers of available panels vs.
	  the number of panels applied for, and assign each artist panels. This may or may not the number
	  you have asked for, depending on how much demand there is.</li>
	  <li>Art production: You will need to make art :-) The art must be in a displayable state (i.e.
	  framed) at the time of the show.</li>
	  <li>Online database: You will be handed a login for an online database. You need this to enter the
	  required information for each piece of art you want to exhibit, and to print bidsheets.</li>
	  <li>Getting the art to the show: You may attend Eurofurence yourself and bring the art with you.
	  Otherwise, you will need to appoint an <strong>agent</strong> who brings the art and picks it up again.</li>
	  <li>Hanging the art: We will provide you with the panels and hooks for hanging, as well as sticky 
	  tape for the bidsheets. It is up to you or your agent to hang the art with the accompanying
	  bidsheets.</li>
	  <li>Leave packaging: It is possible that you leave the packaging for the art in the Art Show.
	  If the art is sold, the buyer will receive the packaging for the transport home.</li>
	  <li>During the Art Show: You don't need to do anything during the Art Show opening times. You may
	  enjoy the convention, or sit in the Dealers' Den (please use the separate application process &ndash;
	  Dealers' tables are not part of the Art Show) for commercial activity. The Art Show will do all
	  the required handling for you, up to the sales.</li>
	  <li>Picking up unsold art: If there is any art unsold (or not for sale), you or your agent need to
	  pick it up after the show closed.</li>
	  <li>Picking up revenue: When the sales are done, the artists will receive an immediate payout
	  on site.</li>
	  <li>Going home.</li>
	</ul>    
	<p>If necessary, we can deviate from the process; but make sure to read the whole documentation to understand
	how these process items work first before asking for an exception.</p>

<h2>Deadlines</h2>
<section>
	<p>The application / registration has a small number of dates you need to be aware of. If you
	don't meet these deadlines, you may cause grievances, delays, or even endanger your participation.</p>

	<ul>
	  <li>The registration for the Art Show starts at the same time as the registration for the
	  convention itself.</li>
	  <li><strong>Applications need to be sent by 31st of March.</strong><br/>
	  It is possible to apply for Art Show space after that, but we will have distributed all available
	  panels then, so unless there are more panels available than needed, you will end up on the 
	  waiting list. There is a chance that you get in, but you will not have a guaranteed space.</li>
	  <li><strong>You can return panels that you don't need until 4 weeks before the con.</strong><br/>
	  If you return unneeded panels later (or do not fill your space at the con) without a very good 
	  reason, we must conclude that you have not properly estimated your requirements, and may give
	  you less space next year.</li>
	  <li><strong>You can change your age rating (but not the total number of panels) until 2 weeks before the con.</strong><br/>
	  After that, we will have designed our panel setup, and cannot move age ratings around any more.
	  You may hang General art on your Adult panel but not vice versa.</li>
	  <li><strong>You can enter data into the online database until the Sunday before the con.</strong><br/>
	  The database is taken offline for use at the con site after that. You can still enter data at the con
	  but there may be waiting times and queues.</li>
	  <li><strong>You may nominate an agent at any time.</strong><br/>
	  It is up to you to make sure we know about this, so don't send an email at the last minute. If
	  it becomes necessary to name an agent at the very last second, call or hand a signed document of proof
	  to the agent that he can use to identify himself.</li>
	  <li><strong>You (or your agent) may hang art on Wednesday afternoon (recommended), or Thursday morning.</strong><br/>
	  It is not recommended to hang art later than that, because the Show will open on Thursday noon, and
	  visitors will be in the show already. If you arrive too late to hang art until then, you may do so
	  during the opening times, but it is awkward.</li>
	  <li><strong>You (or your agent) need to pick up your unsold art on Saturday.</strong> Artists may pick up 
	  unsold art at any time during sales. You need to check out unsold art; get your checkout sheet at
	  the Art Show counter (look for the signs, we provide an extra queue).<br/>
	  The Art Show cannot store any art that you leave behind. If you have any trouble keeping the date,
	  talk to us for a different pickup date. We cannot guarantee the safety of abandoned art.</li>
	  <li><strong>You (or your agent) need to fetch your money after the sales and before the Pawpet Show.</strong><br/>
	  Artists are paid on site for actual sales after all of their sold art pieces have been picked up 
	  and paid for. Therefore, the artist payout depends on the duration of the sales. We may need to be 
	  flexible in this date. We also make allowances in payout time for you, if you ask for it.</li>
	</ul>

	<p>We do assume that these dates are easy to keep, and that you don't start doing art for the show
	three days before the show opens :-)</p>
	
	<br/>

<h2>Agents</h2>
<section class="uk-column-1-2@l">

	<p>It is generally best if an artist comes to Eurofurence personally to hang his art. Sometimes 
	however an artist cannot make it due to time, money, or distance issues. In these cases, that artist
	may appoint an agent to handle the art and the revenue for her or him.</p>

	<p>Note: <strong>It is no longer possible to mail the artwork to the Art Show managers beforehand.</strong>
	Due to the difficulties experienced in the process (customs, fees, danger of damage, return of 
	unsold art), the Art Show cannot perform this service for you. Please find an agent to carry 
	the artwork.</p>

	<p>"Agent" refers to the person that actually comes to EF and works with us in getting the art 
	displayed, sold, and picked up. The agent will handle money for you, so it must be a person
	you trust. The agent can be nominated at any time, but we must be aware of that! We cannot just
	have a stranger come in with your stuff and hang your art and collect money. This may be as well a
	thief that tries to sell stolen goods! Only designated agents may pick up art or money. It is up
	to the agent to identify himself, or to bring proof that he is actually your agent.</p>

	<p>Agents don't need to represent artists 1:1. You can nominate more than one agent (with the 
	proper credentials) if for example one agent brings the art but must leave early, and the 
	other agent will pick up the unsold art and money. An agent also may represent more than one
	artist. And of course one artist can be the agent for another.</p>
	<br/>
	<div>
		<p><strong>How to apply with an agent:</strong></p>
		<ul>
		  <li>The application must still be filled by the artist's data, containing the artist's address 
		  and (private) email.</li>
		  <li>If the agent is supposed to get a copy of the communication, enter his email in the "Additional
		  email address" category. This is not required since the agent's tasks are normally performed at the
		  convention, and the artist's tasks (for which this communication is meant) are performed beforehand.</li>
		  <li>Under "Agent", enter <strong>the agent's full name and nickname</strong> as used at the con. The full name may
		  be needed for official ID.</li>
		  <li>Under "Badge number", enter the agent's badge number.</li>
		  <li>The agent may of course be another artist.</li>
		</ul>
	</div>
	
	<p>The rest of the application is the same as if you'd come to the con yourself! We will happily
	help your agent getting your art displayed.</p>

	<p>If you are an artist, and you are agenting for friends too, you may send all applications in one
	mail. Just use one proper application block (see above) per artist, and enter the correct email and
	agent info per block. Each artist is handled separately and may apply for his or her own panel set.</p>

	<p>Being an agent will not harm your standing when it comes to panel assignments. Agenting only
	affects who is handling art at the con &ndash; the applications are still separate.</p>
	<br/>

<h2>Panel Reservation</h2>
<section class="uk-column-1-2@l">


	<p>When deciding on the number of panels to reserve, <strong>please keep in mind:</strong></p>
	<ul>
	  <li>Most artists only need one panel, at most two. The panels are huge! Unless you are working 
	  in exceptionally large formats, or are very productive, you don't need to order more than 
	  two panels; often even half a panel is enough.</li>
	  <li>Quality before quantity. Yes, we know that you want to sell lots of art, but cramming art 
	  on as many panels as allowed defies the purpose of the Art Show. Be selective; show only your 
	  best. Don't be fixated on sales.</li>
	  <li>Keep a good working relationship with the Art Show staff. They will try to accommodate your 
	  wishes if you keep them up to date with your information.</li>
	  <li>Don't panic. If you can't fill your panels with art, give them back. If you have more art 
	  than you can display on your panels, either select the best &ndash; or bring it to the 
	  convention nevertheless; often, panels become available at the last minute.</li>
	</ul>
	
	<p><strong>How many panels are "good style" to reserve?</strong></p>
	<ul>
	  <li>First, make an estimation of how much art you can bring. This does not need to be a 
	  hundred percent accurate, but you should know how many panels you need. If you have attended 
	  the Art Show before, you most likely know how to do that; if you're a newcomer, you may want 
	  to spend some time on your estimations.</li>
	  <li>Then apply with that estimation in mind. Stay realistic: don't reserve four panels and 
	  later drop three and a half of them.</li>
	  <li>Keep in mind that other artists want to have panels too. We will try to be fair when 
	  assigning panels; your realistic estimation of needed panels will help us in that.</li>
	  <li>If you are a newcomer, we may assign you only limited panel space (one panel). You may want to talk 
	  to us personally when you actually need more than one full panel. We welcome new artists, but 
	  &ndash; due to past experiences &ndash; we would like to build a working relationship with 
	  you before you get multiple panels assigned.</li>
	  <li>If you have a bad track record &ndash; that is, if you have reserved panels at past 
	  Art Shows and then failed to fill them without returning them, or failed to claim your 
	  panels at all, or caused trouble with the Art Show team &ndash; you may want to talk to 
	  us before reserving panels. We might need to curb your reservations to mitigate the apparent risk.</li>
	  <li>After your application, try to keep track of your art progress and the needed panels, 
	  and return panels when you know that you don't need them.</li>
	</ul>
	
	<div>
		<p><strong>How many panels are assigned to you?</strong></p>
		<ul>
		  <li>You will not automatically get the full number of panels that you request. Normally there are
		  more applications for panels than can be fulfilled. Generally, we do not assign more than four
		  panels to an applicant.</li>
		  <li>We will decide on March 31st or shortly after how the available panels are distributed
		  among the applicants.</li>
		  <li>The number of panels that you actually get depends on many criteria: How many panels have
		  been requested all in all vs. how many panels are actually available; are you a newcomer;
		  do you do large formats; what is your technical quality; are you a favorite of the patrons;
		  have you participated in earlier shows; is your content interesting and unique; do you bring 
		  originals; have you filled your panels in the past or let us down? We will have a look at the 
		  examples you provided.</li>
		  <li>We will try to give as many artists as possible a chance, and be fair about the panel
		  distribution. However, we also need to assemble an interesting and varied art show that
		  provides great entertainment for the patrons &ndash; who pay for the show with their con fees!</li>
		  <li>If you do not get the full number of panels that you had requested, you are placed on the
		  waiting list for the difference. You may get more panels at a later time. Previous art shows 
		  have shown that there are always panels left over for various reasons.</li>
		</ul>
	</div>
	
	<p><strong>What happens after that? Are changes possible? Can new panels be ordered?</strong></p>
	<ul>
	  <li>The panels that are confirmed by the Art Show after the close-off date are yours. We will not 
	  take them away or redistribute them unless you return them voluntarily. You can plan your final 
	  layout for the show.</li>
	  <li>You may apply (or try to book additional panels if you need them) at any time even after the
	  closeoff date. However, the panels will most likely be gone by then, and you will end up on the waiting
	  list behind the people that have applied before the closeoff date. We cannot guarantee that you 
	  will get a panel, but some may become available as returns.</li>
	  <li>Panels may become available at the con itself if an artist returns panels at the last minute, 
	  brings less art than anticipated, or fails to show up. So, panels may be reassigned even at the 
	  convention! This happens frequently. Don't hesitate to bring (additional) art and ask!</li>
	</ul>
	
	<p>It is not possible to give your space to someone else in person, since that may lead to an unfair 
	panel distribution. Panels must be officially redistributed. That includes panels you reserved for friends 
	that you represent at the con as an agent &ndash; if those friends do not use all of their panel space, 
	you cannot simply take that space for yourself; it must be returned to the Art Show pool.</p>
	
	<p>Since only a few people need tables instead of panels, tables will be set up as needed.</p>
	
	<br/>

<h2>Sharing Panels</h2>
<section class="uk-column-1-2@l">
    
	<p>Occasionally, an artist (let's call him/her the "main artist") brings just one or two pieces for 
	a friend (let's call her/him the "sharing artist"), insufficient material for a panel of their own. 
	This is fine with us, however, we need to formalize the process. In the past, this
	has been handled informally by just entering the proper artist on the bidsheet, and not giving us any
	data on the additional artist. This will no longer suffice.</p>

	
	<p><strong>How to apply with shared panels:</strong></p>
	<ul>
		<li>The application of the main artist must be filled by the artist's data, containing the artist's address 
		and (private) email. Handle this like a normal application.</li>
		<li>For each sharing artist: Add a complete application block.</li>
		<li>As number of panels/tables, write in: "Shared with artist X". We will then know that this
		applicant does not need an extra panel or table. Be aware of the age rating!</li>
		<li>If the extra artist shall receive mail from the art show, fill the field "Private email" with
		his or her contact address. You may leave this empty as well, in which case only the main artist
		will receive communication.</li>
		<li>The sharing artist will set his/her agent as the main artist.</li>
		<li>If the main artist is already using an agent, the sharing artist must nominate the same agent.
		It is not possible to have two different agents working with the same shared panel(s).</li>
		<li>Since a sharing artist always has an agent by default, he/she needs to leave it to that
		agent to handle the hanging and the pickup, even if the sharing artist is at the con.</li>
	</ul>
	
	<p>It is up to the main artist (or his/her agent) how to hang the sharing artist's contributions.
	The main artist will need to handle all issues arising with this application.</p>

	<p>Now, why so formal? Do we really need to know who hangs whose art? &ndash; This is needed for
	several reasons. First, if the main artist gets sick, what would happen to the sharing artist if
	we don't know about him? He may be at the con, he may bring art along, but he will not be in our
	database, and we can't give him a panel because we have never seen him apply! Given the full
	registration of sharing artists, we will know that he was supposed to have art in the show, and
	can use the main artist's panel to accommodate him. Second, "anonymous" sharing artists may
	circumvent any bans, restrictions, or checks we choose to impose on that artist. And third, if
	you tell us that you are the main artist who shares a panel with others, we might not reduce
	your panel space as much, if such a reduction is needed.</p>

<h2>Signup and Application</h2>
		
<section class="uk-column-1-2@l">
	<ul>
		<li>Lines with a preceding asterisk (*) are mandatory.</li>
		<li>The private email address is the one we will use to contact you. Most likely it is the address where the application came from. You may enter more than one address. It is up to you to keep it valid, or inform us of changes.</li>
		<li>The badge number refers to the person that we will meet at the con, which is either you or your agent. You may give us your badge number later if you are not yet registered with Eurofurence.</li>
		<li>Contact information is private and will normally not be disclosed. The public contact info that you can enter in the Art Show database will be included with the customer receipts  so a customer is able to contact you for questions. The email address provided with the application is not shown anywhere.</li>
		<li>Phone is not mandatory but it may come in handy in emergency cases.</li>
		<li>The email we receive this application from is the one we respond to. Under 'Additional email address' you can add more addresses, e.g. if you want to keep your agent informed, but this field is not mandatory.</li>
		<li>Note that your address is mandatory. Should there be legal disputes of any sort that cannot be resolved by an email exchange, we may be obliged to pass this address to officials or involved parties. Patrons and customers will not see your address.</li>
		<li>You may ask for half panels and half tables. Find the panel sizes, shapes, and structures in the Artist Guide section.</li>
		<li>The number of panels/tables should be what you can fill and wish to fill. We cannot guarantee that this is the number of panels or tables that we can actually allocate to you. Desired panels that we cannot give to you immediately may become available at a later time. See below for a discussion on panel distribution.</li>
		<li>Your example art should represent the kind of art you wish to display.</li>
		<li>Check the last four lines like this [x] if applicable.</li>
		<li>The panels will be distributed after March 31st. If we have not received your application by then, you will end up on the waiting list.</li>
		<li>Be sure to fill out your application truthfully and correctly. Incomplete applications will be rejected.</li>
