<h1>Art Show &ndash; Bidding Rules</h1>
<section>
    <p>This section will inform you in advance about the bidding process. You don't actually have to take any action before the convention itself; there is no bidder pre-registration.</p>

		<h2><a class="anchor" id="bidnumber"></a>Register for a Bidder Number</h2>
		
		<p>The Eurofurence Art Show does not sell or buy art. It acts solely as mediator 
		for sales from sellers to buyers. For this purpose, buyers need to register with 
		their name, EF badge number, and contact details. The name and contact will be 
		passed on to the seller for every confirmed sale, and the seller's contact data 
		(as provided by artist or agent) will be passed to the buyer with the final 
		receipts.</p> 
		
		<p>Please don't wait until the last second to register &mdash; we can handle only so many 
		bidders per hour. Registration will be available during opening times, but not while 
		closing, and not during the auction, so please make sure you are registered 
		<i>beforehand</i>.</p>
		
		<p>Naturally, it is not necessary to register as a bidder to just visit the show.</p>

		<h2><a class="anchor" id="howtobid"></a>How to bid</h2>
		
		<p>At the Art Show registration, buyers will receive a copy of these rules and a sheet 
		with bid stickers, which contain an anonymous bidder number.</p>
		
		<p><b>To bid on an exhibit</b>:</p>
		
		<ul>
		  <li>The buyer writes his bid on a sticker.</li>
		  <li>The bid must be in whole Euros.</li>
		  <li>No "fun amounts" like "three times pi plus seven" please. We do not want to solve 
		  mathematical equations. (Especially when it does not even amount to whole Euros.)</li>
		  <li>The bid needs to be <i>as much as or more</i> than the minimum bid, and <i>more</i> than 
		  any previous bid.</li>
		  <li>The buyer sticks the bid sticker to the bidsheet, in the first free bidding field.</li>
		  <li>If there is no free bidding field left, the exhibit will go to auction, see below.</li>
		</ul>
		
		<p>A buyer may get new bid stickers any time if he needs more stickers than available on a 
		sheet. He/she can bid as often as desired on any "for sale" exhibit (if no bidding fields 
		are left, further bidding must be taken to auction). There are exhibits which are not for 
		sale, and cannot be bid on.</p>	
		
		<p><b>Important</b>:</p>
		
		<ul>
		  <li>A bid is a valid offer to buy, and must be honored.</li>
		  <li>A bid sticker must not be removed from a bidsheet, or changed after bidding. In case of 
		  mistaken bids, the buyer can inform the Art Show management, which will replace the bidsheet 
		  and invalidate the bid.</li>
		  <li>A buyer must keep his bid sticker sheet safe, to prevent others to bid in his name.</li>
		  <li>Collusion between artist/agent and buyer is forbidden. Fake bids, bids on one's own 
		  exhibit for the purpose of raising the price, or bidding in another's name against that 
		  person's will is prohibited.</li>
		</ul>

		<h2><a class="anchor" id="closing"></a>Closing the Art Show</h2>
		
		<p>When the Art Show closes for good, every buyer gets the opportunity for final bids, until 
		the exhibit in question goes to auction, or no more bids are offered. For this purpose, 
		the Art Show team will close the show panel by panel (in the order of panel numbers) and 
		call for final bids which must be placed on the spot. Once no more bids are offered, the 
		panel counts as closed, the bidsheets are marked off, and no further changes are allowed.</p>
		
		<p>That means: It is useless to wait with bids until the show closes, or to "guard" an exhibit 
		at closing time. To secure an exhibit, bid early, bid often to outdo competitors!</p>
		
		<p><b>Warning</b>: If people crowd the show, security may deem it necessary to close the room 
		and restrict admittance to prevent damage to the exhibits, or even worse, damage to the 
		health of attendees. This may prevent you from placing final bids. We're sorry for this 
		possible inconvenience.</p> 
		
		<p>If you have no more bids to place during closing, please leave the show to prevent crowding.</p>
		
	</div>
	<div class="retain">
	
		<h2><a class="anchor" id="auction"></a>Art Auction</h2>
		
		<p>The auction is the final opportunity to buy disputed exhibits which have generated so much interest
		that the bidsheet is filled with bids. It is a voice auction, moderated by an auctioneer. Buyers can 
		bid with their bidder number or their EF badge number. There is no upper limits to bids, but remember 
		that you need to pay for the item at the convention in cash (see "Sales").</p>
		
		<p>If you have bid on a piece that went to auction, make sure you attend this event, no matter 
		whether your bid was the last on the bidsheet or not. Anybody may bid on any piece, not just 
		the previous bidders, so you may lose the object of your desire! If no further bids are made 
		beyond the bidsheet's, the exhibit goes to the last bidder on the bidsheet.</p>
		
		<p>Depending on the number of auctioned exhibits, this event may take some time. General audience 
		and adult items are auctioned at the same event; there is no separate adult auction.</p>
		
	</div>

		<h2><a class="anchor" id="pickup"></a>Sales and Artwork Pickup</h2>
		
		<p>Final winners of the art are announced by bulletin. The lists can be found in some appropriate 
		place (most likely in front of the Art Show).</p>
		
		<p>Buyers must pick up their purchase at the designated art pickup times, and pay cash. Credit 
		cards or cheques of any kind are not accepted. We will try to keep the lines as short as 
		possible.</p>
		
		<p>If you do not pick up your items, we will try to contact you, but please save us this effort. 
		Neither we nor the artist will be very pleased. Remember, it may not be possible (or safe) 
		to send the art you bought by mail. The artists rely on you! Check the winners' lists!</p>
		
		<p>If you are sure you have won a piece, but don't find your number on the winners' list or
		are told at the counter that you haven't won it, speak up, so we can counter-check. The
		Art Show involves a lot of manual work, with a lot of numbers. While we try to double- and
		triple-check, mistakes are still possible.</p>

		<h2><a class="anchor" id="tips"></a>Tips on bidding</h2>
		
		<ul>
		  <li>The Art Show offers you "helper sheets" where you can write down the items you have bid on,
		  the panels where they hang, and the amount you have bid. This is useful to keep an overview over
		  the art you were interested in, and the total sum.</li>
		  <li>Keep in mind that you may win all the pieces you bid on, and have the necessary cash funds
		  available.</li>
		  <li>The Art Show supplies wood boards you can carry in the show, and write on, as well as pens.</li>
		  <li>If you place a bid, <b>first</b> write the bid amount on the sticker (you have that wood
		  board, remember) and <b>then</b> pull off the sticker and paste it to the bidsheet. It is difficult
		  to write on the panels if you first paste the bare sticker, and then try to scribble a number,
		  because the panels have lots of holes.</li>
		  <li>Write legible. Should go without saying.</li>
		  <li>If you make a mistake, come to the Art Show counter and ask the personnel about it. Do not
		  change a bidsheet on your own, this will cause irritations.</li>
		  <li>We cannot answer specific questions on art pieces beyond the information on the bidsheet.
		  You may be able to contact the artist to ask her or him personally. Perhaps you can find the
		  artist in the Dealers' Den.</li>
		  <li>Please do not assume you have won nothing, or won everything. If you have placed any bids, check
		  the winner lists or ask at the sales counter. Even if your favorite piece has gone to auction and
		  you missed the auction altogether, it might still be yours if no one else bid on it.</li>
		  <li>Some art comes with packaging; there will be small numbered tickets with the bidsheets. You
		  will receive some packaging with the art at sales time (may be complete boxes or just bubble wrap). 
		  This may not be totally sufficient for transport (esp. overseas) but should help you in securing
		  your purchased art a bit better.</li>
		  <li>The bid stickers keep the bidding semi-anonymous, but naturally anybody may see you placing
		  a bid. Likewise, in the auction you need to speak up to bid. Anonymity is not guaranteed.</li>
		  <li>And once again, because it is important: <strong>Do not lose your bid stickers!</strong>
		  Someone else may find it and use it to bid in your name.</li>
		</ul>
