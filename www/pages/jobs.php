			<div class="uk-accordion-content uk-column-1-2@l">
				<p>The fursuit support team is the friendly crew in the background, who keeps the growing number of fursuiters alive at Eurofurence each year. We’re the ones</p>
				<ul>
					<li>running the fursuit lounge</li>
					<li>providing dances and panels with blowers and refreshments</li>
					<li>planning fursuit excursions and the parade</li>
					<li>providing service and help with any fursuit related issue</li>
				</ul>
				<p>Being part of the fursuit team is one of the best ways to make sure you get to meet all those fluffballs first hand. Currently the team consists of about 25 volunteers.</p>
				<p>The main driving force of the team, and a genuine staff position. You have attended EF a few times and know your way around? Maybe you even worked for the convention before and want to keep being awesome to others in general and fursuiters especially? Much like the helper, your job is to keep the lounge running and equipped, keep an open eye for any medical or social emergencies in the lounge, and assist with fursuit events if needed. You will also be running your timeslot shift as “person in charge” either alone or with a helper.</p>
				<p>You can also specialise on a certain aspect of duties. Purchase preparations, resource management, construction,..</p>
				<p>You may have to dedicate a few more hours during the convention, as we need to fill all timeslots with responsible people. We also need people to help with setup and breakdown on early-day and on dead-dog day, and would love to see you there if any possible.</p>

				<p>Our convention keeps growing significantly and we're glad to see even more happy faces each year. However, as the attendance continues to grow, we are looking for additional volunteers for our Security Team to make sure we can provide our guests with the high level of service we've established over the last 20 years.</p>
				<div>
					<p>If you're interested in volunteering at Eurofurence, now is a good time to become a member of the Security Team. You'll get to see how this convention works behind the scenes, meet a lot of people and help making community events like Eurofurence possible at all. Oh and free coffee ;) What's not to love?</p>
				</div>
				<div>
					<p>All members of Security are Furries themselves and want to enjoy Eurofurence as much as you do. We're making sure there is plenty of time to take part in the convention -- it's supposed to be a vacation, after all.</p>
				</div>
				<div>
					<p>Over the years, we established a balance between fun and professionalism that is working out very well. We take our job serious, not ourselves.</p>
				</div>
				<div>
					<p>Your job will be to make the convention safe and enjoyable for our guests. We provide a lot more than a typical bouncer: we care about our guests and strife to make them feel welcome. A polite and friendly demeanour is an absolute must at all times. Also, you'll need to bring the following:</p>
				</div>
				<div>
					<ul>
						<li>Sufficient fluency in English to communicate with our attendees. Fluency in German or other languages is a plus.</li>
						<li>Willingness to work at least around 18 to 20 hours, averaged during the whole convention. There is a variety of duties to take on: Art Show, Queue Control, Frontoffice Service, Dances, Dispatching, Doorduty, ... and many more require different services our team provides. We will develop your duty schedule according to your individual preferences and make sure it's not colliding with any event you want to attend.</li>
						<li>Willingness to carry a handheld radio on your belt and be on standby in addition to your scheduled shifts. You can end your standby shift and put your radio away at any time, to go and enjoy the convention.</li>
						<li>Punctuality and reliability. We need to be sure you will show up to your assigned duties.</li>
						<li>Willingness to go through an online course regarding Security Basics and the Rules of Conduct. It won't take too long and is actually interesting. You could even learn something useful for everyday life.</li>
						<li>A responsible and respectable behaviour - even in a situation with conflict of interests - and a drama-free reputation.</li>
						<li>No tasks in other teams during the convention besides setup and teardown. We don't want to burn anyone out.</li>
					</ul>
				</div>
				<div>
					<p>You will be provided with everything you'll need for your duties. We will not just thrust a radio into your hands and throw you to the wolves, you will get training and personal coaching. No-one works alone during their shifts and you can contact your Team Leader or Dispatch (yes, we have a whole dispatching system, custom software and all - you'll love it) at any time. After your first year, we offer advanced training that can bring you at the same level as a professional Security officer, so you'll be able to lead your own team or checkpoint.</p>
				</div>
				<div>
					<p>We will conduct a short voice-chat with you to get to know you a bit. Don't worry, this is not an interrogation, but a personal chat between you and our recruitment office to make sure we're on the same page about any questions you might have.</p>
