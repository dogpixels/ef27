		<div class="jobpanel two_columns just">
			<p>Eurofurence is Europe's largest furry convention, entirely run by volunteers. It is operated by <a href="https://www.eurofurence.de/">Eurofurence e.V.</a>, a non-profit incorporated social organisation dedicated to fans of anthropomorphic characters.</p>

			<p>Our registration software is currently used by Eurofurence and <a href="https://www.mephitminicon.de/">MMC</a>. Right now, it is mostly a monolithic Java web application that can handle registration, payments, accounting, and room planning. We have recently begun the process of a step-by-step modernisation, introducing a statically hosted web frontend (HTML, CSS, JS) and two microservices (Go) for selected parts of our registration process. Experiences with this approach have been very positive, so we would like to keep going in this direction.</p>

			<p>To extend our existing team, we are looking for 2 frontend developers with long term commitment in a volunteer position.</p>

			<h3>What should you bring?</h3>
			<ul>
				<li>ability to create user friendly and clear visual design</li>
				<li>experience with modern web frontend development</li>
				<li>experience with using REST APIs from a static web frontend</li>
				<li>awareness and knowledge of security best practices</li>
				<li>familiarity with git</li>
				<li>ability to plan your time (within reasonable limits, and only in your spare time of course)</li>
				<li>ability to attend voice chat meetings about once a month during German evening time on weekdays (we usually hold a vote on the exact date)</li>
				<li>comfortable with a team that collaborates online</li>
				<li>optional: basic understanding of the German language would be helpful but is not required</li>
			</ul>
			<br/>
			<h3>What will you be doing?</h3>
			<p>You will be working on MIT licensed Open Source software, which we currently host on our <a href="https://github.com/eurofurence">GitHub account</a>, using a modern architecture clearly separated into multiple areas of front-to-back responsibilities, each supported by a small number of services in the backend.</p>
			<ul>
				<li>develop end user facing UI for our registration system</li>
					<ul>
						<li>internationalised</li>
						<li>multilingual (we'll start with English and German)</li>
						<li>clear and maintainable</li>
						<li>designed to be statically hosted on our servers with no cross-site dependencies</li>
						<li>with support for current browsers on both mobile devices and regular computers (we don't care about Internet Explorer, but Chrome, Firefox, Edge, Safari, Android and iOS are a must)</li>
					</ul>
				<li>participate in testing & peer review and write automated unit, integration and end-to-end tests</li>
				<li>collaborate with us on the architectural design of the application(s) and APIs</li>
				<li>help us automate deployment on our Linux servers</li>
			</ul><br/>
			<b>Okay, my hourly rate is ...!</b>
			<p>None of the 300+ volunteers who prepare and run Eurofurence get paid. We realise this may not be for everyone, but we are and always have been a non-profit organization.</p>

			<p>In the same spirit, all registration software created by the team will be published under a free (as in beer) and free (as in freedom) license, so other conventions, furry or not, will be able to benefit from our work.</p>

			<p>We are currently in the software design phase, so if you join now you will be able to help us decide on the tools to be used. We are convinced that those who put in the work have the right to make this decision, along with our existing developers, as we will all have to live with the choices made.</p>

			<p>One of the perks of working on registration software is that there is very little to do during the actual convention, so this job does not interfere with your enjoyment of Eurofurence, or - should you so choose - other volunteer duties during the convention.</p>
			<p>However, working on our registration software tends to have periods of high activity especially in October through January, which may conflict with duties in other departments. When applying, please state which other departments you are part of / have applied to, so we can take this into account and consider this.</p>
			<br/>
			<h3>Contact details</h3>
			<p>In case of questions or if you would like to apply please contact us by mail: <a href="mailto:&#114;&#101;&#103;&#100;&#101;&#118;&#064;&#101;&#117;&#114;&#111;&#102;&#117;&#114;&#101;&#110;&#099;&#101;&#046;&#111;&#114;&#103;">&#114;&#101;&#103;&#100;&#101;&#118;&#064;&#101;&#117;&#114;&#111;&#102;&#117;&#114;&#101;&#110;&#099;&#101;&#046;&#111;&#114;&#103;</a>.</p>

			<p>This is our entry level job in the team, and perfect for anyone willing to test the waters of convention teamwork. We will ask you to dedicate about 1 or 2 hours a day to help with refilling the water dispensers and snacks, keeping the lounge clean and occasionally get a few things from A to B.

			<p>The main driving force of the team, and a genuine staff position. You have attended EF a few times and know your way around? Maybe you even worked for the convention before and want to keep being awesome to others in general and fursuiters especially? Much like the helper, your job is to keep the lounge running and equipped, keep an open eye for any medical or social emergencies in the lounge, and assist with fursuit events if needed. You will also be running your timeslot shift as “person in charge” either alone or with a helper.</p>
			<p>You can also specialise on a certain aspect of duties. Purchase preparations, resource management, construction,..</p>
			<p>You may have to dedicate a few more hours during the convention, as we need to fill all timeslots with responsible people. We also need people to help with setup and breakdown on early-day and on dead-dog day, and would love to see you there if any possible.</p>

			<p>Our convention keeps growing significantly and we're glad to see even more happy faces each year. However, as the attendance continues to grow, we are looking for additional volunteers for our Security Team to make sure we can provide our guests with the high level of service we've established over the last 20 years.</p>
			<div class="retain">
				<p>If you're interested in volunteering at Eurofurence, now is a good time to become a member of the Security Team. You'll get to see how this convention works behind the scenes, meet a lot of people and help making community events like Eurofurence possible at all. Oh and free coffee ;) What's not to love?</p>
			</div>
			<div class="retain">
				<p>All members of Security are Furries themselves and want to enjoy Eurofurence as much as you do. We're making sure there is plenty of time to take part in the convention -- it's supposed to be a vacation, after all.</p>
			</div>
			<div class="retain">
				<p>Over the years, we established a balance between fun and professionalism that is working out very well. We take our job serious, not ourselves.</p>
			</div>
			<div class="retain">
				<p>Your job will be to make the convention safe and enjoyable for our guests. We provide a lot more than a typical bouncer: we care about our guests and strife to make them feel welcome. A polite and friendly demeanour is an absolute must at all times. Also, you'll need to bring the following:</p>
			</div>
			<div>
				<ul>
					<li class="retain">Sufficient fluency in English to communicate with our attendees. Fluency in German or other languages is a plus.</li>
					<li class="retain">Willingness to work at least twelve 1-hour timeslots during the whole convention.

					<li class="retain">Willingness to carry a handheld radio on your belt and be on standby during your off-duty time, but only for as long as you like. You can sign off, put your radio away and go have a drink at any time.</li>
					<li class="retain">Punctuality and reliability. We need to be sure you will show up to your assigned duties.</li>
					<li class="retain">Willingness to go through an online course regarding Security Basics and the Rules of Conduct. It won't take too long and is actually interesting. You could even learn something useful for everyday life.</li>
					<li class="retain">A responsible and respectable behaviour - even in a situation with conflict of interests - and a drama-free reputation.</li>
					<li class="retain">No tasks in other teams during the convention besides setup and teardown. We don't want to burn anyone out.</li>
				</ul>
			</div>
			<div class="retain">
				<p>You will be provided with everything you'll need for your duties. We will not just thrust a radio into your hands and throw you to the wolves, you will get training and personal coaching. No-one works alone during their shifts and you can contact your Team Leader or Dispatch (yes, we have a whole dispatching system, custom software and all - you'll love it) at any time. After your first year, we offer advanced training that can bring you at the same level as a professional Security officer, so you'll be able to lead your own team or checkpoint.</p>
			</div>
			<div class="retain">
				<p>We will conduct a short voice-chat with you to get to know you a bit. Don't worry, this is not an interrogation, but a personal chat between you, me and and my recruitment office to make sure we're on the same page about any questions you might have.</p>
			</div>
