<h1>Art Show &ndash; Artist Guide</h1>
<section>
	<p>This is your comprehensive guide on how to prepare your artwork for display. There aren't many requirements, but some have to be met in order to keep the process smooth for everyone.</p>

<h2>Technical Requirements</h2>
<section class="two_columns just">
    <p class="retain just">The Eurofurence Art Show provides panels and hooks for hanging art. The panels are 
    sturdy wooden constructs with predrilled pegboard sides where hooks can be inserted. 
    All panels are usable from both sides. See below for images!</p>
    <p class="retain just">The managers lay out the panels in the room to meet a number of requirements. 
    The artists will normally not be able to request a certain layout (you can ask to be 
    placed next to a friend; we try to honor these requests, but don't guarantee it). 
    Panels are assigned.</p>
    <p class="retain just">To hang artwork, it must have a tab at the backside which fits the hooks. Please 
    note that commercially available frames may come with tabs or holders that do not fit 
    these hooks because they are designed for screws or nails. Eurofurence tries to make 
    different hooks and additional clamp holders available; these will be on hand in 
    limited numbers only, though. It is forbidden to paste the artwork to the panel with 
    sticky tape or any other adhesive; this will ruin both the panel and the artwork.</p>
    <p class="retain just"><a href="https://www.eurofurence.org/EF15/Panelplan-EF15.pdf" target="_blank"><img src="img/pages/artshow/panel-size-sm.gif" alt="Panels" /></a></p>
    <p class="retain just"><strong>Panels may be reserved in half-panel steps.</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>a full panel will be 2m by 1m (6.56 by 3.28 feet)</strong></li>
      <li><strong>a half panel will be 1m by 1m (3.28 by 3.28 feet)</strong></li>
    </ul>
    <p class="retain just">Please remember that the space you reserve must include some clearance between pieces, 
    including space for the bid sheets. Your artwork may not extend beyond the edge of any 
    panel. It may not interfere with any works displayed by other artists.</p>
    <p class="retain just">If you have never done this before, you can try the layout for your art at home: 
    Arrange your framed and matted pieces on the floor, and try out what looks best. This 
    will give you an idea of how much panel space you need to reserve. Look here for a 
    sketch with example sizes:&nbsp;<a href="https://www.eurofurence.org/EF15/Panelplan-EF15.pdf" target="_blank">Panel Layout</a>.</p>
    <p class="retain just">If you have extremely large pieces of art where a full panel would not suffice to hang 
    it, or extremely heavy framing (wooden frame and glass) you need two people to lift, 
    please contact the managers immediately so something can be worked out for that kind 
    of artwork.</p>
    <p class="retain just">If you have three-dimensional artwork to display, you need a table instead of 
    (or in addition to) a panel. The mail application will allow you to request 
    tables. Since the tables are provided by the location, the sizes may vary. Please 
    be prepared to change your setup according to final measurements. Note that the 
    panels/tables are unprotected and open; if your art breaks easily, bring a showcase 
    or a cover to discourage patrons who &quot;look with their fingers&quot;. You are 
    responsible for the protection of the artwork yourself.</p>
    <p class="retain just"><strong>Additional decoration of panels is restricted.</strong></p>
    <p class="retain just">Panels are meant for the display of artwork, bidsheets and accompanying information. 
    Draping the panels with cloth or paper as background or table-cloth is not allowed. 
    Permanent changes to the panels, like paint, are of course strictly prohibited.</p>
    <p class="retain just">You may add artist information, like a box with business cards, to your panel. 
    You may add small items as decoration, but any such items are displayed at the 
    discretion of the Art Show managers, who may ask you to remove them if they do not 
    fit in. (It is also not very polite to clutter panels with gadgets that take up space 
    which may be used by other artists for their works.)</p>
    <p class="retain just">Due to fire hazard, it is not allowed to add any electrical appliance to the panel 
    that runs on more than standard batteries. That concerns moving installations, lamps, 
    and electronic displays.</p>
    <p class="retain just">The Eurofurence Art Show managers will try to fulfill all your needs in displaying 
    your work. However, they cannot read minds, and not all requirements can be met 
    on-site, so if you plan something special, get in contact with them as soon as 
    possible.</p>

<h2>Online Art Database</h2>
<section class="just">
	<div>  
		<p class="retain just">After application for the Art Show, you will receive your password and account data for the online
		art database once that goes online. Through the online system, you can enter your art data and create 
		and print bidsheets. This data is also essential in the administration of the Art Show: it is the basic 
		information on how much art we have, to whom it belongs, and how it is supposed to be handled.</p>
		<p class="retain just">Through that system, your receipts will be printed and your revenue will be calculated. Any data 
		that is not entered before the con has to be entered at the con, which takes a lot of time. Thus, 
		please register your art online ahead of the con, and help reduce waiting times at the con itself.</p>
		<p class="retain just">The online database comes with its own help system, so we will not repeat this information here.</p>
	</div>

<h2>Bidsheets and Selling Art</h2>
<section class="two_columns just">
	
	<div>  
		
		<p class="retain just"> The Art Show allows you to sell your art. Please note that the show doesn't buy art, or sell art to 
		bidders. The Art Show acts exclusively as a mediator in a contract between artist/owner and buyer
		(selling on commission with no fee).</p>	
		<p class="retain just">Each piece of art will have a bidsheet attached (or have it hanging next to the piece) which provides 
		information on the artwork, the artist, and more. The bidsheet is used for identification of the art, 
		and for purchasing art. A piece of art is marked as &quot;not for sale&quot; by a special no-sale 
		bidsheet that does not provide the purchase-related part.</p>
		<p class="retain just">If you don't want to sell your art, you simply use the no-sale bidsheet (you can mark a piece as 
		not-for-sale in the online database, which will automatically select the correct bidsheet). This 
		sheet still gives the visitor all necessary information about the art and the artist, but does not 
		set a price or allow to bid on this piece.</p>	
		<p class="retain just">If you want to sell your art, you use the sales bidsheet. Here, you need to state a minimum price, 
		which is essentially the smallest sum you want to sell the piece for.</p>
		<p class="retain just">Bidsheets are available through the online database. If you do not have a printer available, you 
		may print them at the convention; however, it is recommended that you print bidsheets before 
		the con to avoid waiting times.</p>
		<p class="retain just">Visitors of the art show may bid on &quot;for sale&quot; pieces by writing their bid onto the 
		corresponding bidsheet. The bid must meet the minimum price. The piece is sold to the highest bid 
		at the end of the show. If the maximum number of bids are offered, the piece will be sold in the art 
		show auction, which is a voice auction, and has no bidding limits.</p>	
		<p class="retain just">After the auction (at a time to be announced at the convention), the art will be handed out to 
		the customers, the money will be collected and finally given to the artists/owners. This is done 
		for practical reasons: Eurofurence does not act as a buyer or reseller. The artists will receive 
		the data of their buyers (and vice versa) to finalize the contract. Eurofurence will try to mediate 
		in cases of problematic purchase, but it is up to the artist to verify and claim their money.</p>
		<p class="retain just">If artwork is sold but not collected and paid for by the 
		bidder, we will try to notify the buyer of this mishap, and correct it before passing the money 
		to the artist/agent. Should this not be possible, for example if the buyer has already left the 
		convention, the artist or agent will be informed and provided with contact data to enable him/her 
		to finalize the sale. Eurofurence cannot hand out money that has not been collected beforehand, 
		and since the sales agreement is between the bidder and the artist/agent, Eurofurence cannot 
		legally exact payment. The artist is free to take any measure to enforce the contract that has 
		been concluded with the bidder.</p>
		<p class="retain just">Unsold pieces (having no bid) or &quot;Not for sale&quot; pieces are returned to the owner at the 
		end of the art show.</p>
		<p class="retain just">Please note that any and all additional obligation like sales tax or income tax declarations have 
		to be fulfilled by the artist/owner. Eurofurence assumes that the transactions are handled as 
		private sales. If you are a (commercial) full-time artist, you may be required to file these sales 
		properly, and to hand out the appropriate receipts to the customers.</p>

<h2>Choosing Prices</h2>
<section class="just">
	
	<div> 
		<p class="retain just">The choice of a good minimum price is crucial for the sales. If your minimum is too low, you 
		will be disappointed if the art sells for just that sum. If your minimum is too high, you may 
		need to take it back because no one is willing to pay that initial price.</p> 
		<p class="retain just">Some artists have tried to get their art into the auction by choosing very low minimum bids, 
		since art in the auction may yield a higher price than in the regular bidding. However, 
		in many cases that art still does not get the necessary number of bids to send it to the 
		auction, and is sold for a low bid.</p>
		<p class="retain just">The Art Show managers cannot offer advice in choosing the minimum bid, since the buying 
		behavior of the Eurofurence patrons often varies. Generally, you should ask yourself whether 
		you really want to part with this piece for that minimum price, and still be comfortable with 
		it. This depends largely on how you see your art: as a source to make prints from, as 
		lovingly created unique pieces of art, as advertising for your commissions, as leisurely hobby, 
		or as additional income.</p>
	</div>

<h2>Art Show Awards</h2>
<section class="just">
	
	<div> 
		<p class="retain just">For some years, Eurofurence has handed out awards for outstanding pieces. These awards 
		consist of a prize ribbon which you can take home with you and display in your living room.</p>   
		<p class="retain just">Four awards are handed out: Art Show Manager's Choice [1], Art Show Manager's Choice [2] (there are
		two art show manager, so there!), Chairman's Choice, and Guest of Honor Choice. Each award is 
		selected by only that person, not by committee.</p>  
		<p class="retain just">Since the prizes are awarded by very different people (the guest of honor even changing by the year),
		the criteria are various. Beyond technical prowess, graphic design, color choice, humor and
		originality are considered just as anatomy, perspective, depth, or expression are. The jurors
		may also take into account whether the piece comes as an original or just as a reproduction.</p> 
		<p class="retain just">After the con, the awarded pieces are also displayed on the EF web site.</p>

<h2>Art Show Images</h2>
<section class="two_columns just">
	
	<div> 
		<p class="retain just">How does the Art Show look? What are the "panels"? How will art be hung on the panel? Well, 
		it's easier to show than to tell, and one image is worth 1000 words, so let's begin. Click on 
		an image to get a larger version!</p>
		<span class="divider"></span>
		<a href="img/pages/artshow/artshow_01.jpg" data-lightbox="artshowguide" rel="lightbox"><img class="as_prev" src="img/pages/artshow/artshow_01small.jpg" alt="frame" /></a>
		<p class="retain just">This is how a completed panel looks like. Many thanks to AlectorFencer for allowing us to 
		use her setup. That is only one example how panels may be set up; the actual layout of the 
		art show depends on the ratio of adult and general art, security and convenience issues, and 
		technical factors.</p>   
		<p class="retain just">You can see a complete nook with three panel sides and one table. Depending on the number 
		of panels you got, you may have a nook or a wall for yourself, or you may need to share even 
		the space on one single panel with someone else. There are also panels available of half the 
		width, which you normally just get if you have only half a panel (or less) in total.</p>   
		<p class="retain just">You can not influence the layout of the Art Show or the placement of your panel(s) beyond 
		the separation of adult and general art. The panels are distributed among artists in a way that 
		keeps artists' panels together. You can contact us if you have special needs; we will try to help 
		you to realize your creative ideas. No guarantees can be given however.</p>  
		<p class="retain just">Tables can be placed in nooks. Note that the table offers less space than the panel, but 
		is the only way to display 3D art that cannot be hung. There is no showcase for your art, so 
		if you have delicate art that must not be touched, better bring a protective showcase with you. 
		It is not allowed to touch the art, but we can't have eyes everywhere, and some people love 
		to look with their fingers.</p>
		<p class="retain just">Please ignore the boxes under the table; we provide a separate space for your packing material 
		that you want to give to the buyer.</p>
		<span class="divider"></span>
		<a href="img/pages/artshow/artshow_02.jpg" data-lightbox="artshowguide" rel="lightbox"><img class="as_prev" src="img/pages/artshow/artshow_02small.jpg" alt="frame" /></a>
		<p class="retain just">This is the empty panel that will greet you. The instruction sheet states your name and tells 
		you what to do. Once you're done with the setup, you are asked to return this sheet with your 
		signature and have an Art Show manager inspect your setup and check whether you follow the rules.</p>
		<span class="divider"></span>
		<a href="img/pages/artshow/artshow_03.jpg" data-lightbox="artshowguide" rel="lightbox"><img class="as_prev" src="img/pages/artshow/artshow_03small.jpg" alt="frame" /></a>
		<p class="retain just">These are the hooks that are available to hang art. There are different sizes to allow for even 
		large framed pieces to be hung.</p>  
		<p class="retain just">The top part goes into the panel holes. No, they don't slide out. Some of the holes may be blocked 
		by the construction frame behind it, but most are usable.</p>   
		<p class="retain just">And no, you are not supposed to drill new holes, use nails, or glue your art to the panel. We 
		love our panels, so please don't deface them.</p>
		<span class="divider"></span>
		<a href="img/pages/artshow/artshow_04.jpg" data-lightbox="artshowguide" rel="lightbox"><img class="as_prev" src="img/pages/artshow/artshow_04small.jpg" alt="frame" /></a>
		<p class="retain just">How can art be hung with these hooks? Obviously you need a bail / an eye on your frame. Most frames 
		come with something like the eye on the left side, screwed to the upper frame. In cheap glass frames, 
		the eye may be part of the connectors that hold glass front and backplate together. Make sure that 
		your frame has an eye (or several) so you can hang it.</p>   
		<p class="retain just">The clamps in the middle and to the right are what the EF Art Show can offer. These are meant 
		for matted art &mdash; they will not hold anything heavier than a cardboard frame (art will slip out) 
		but for these it works fine.</p>
		<span class="divider"></span>
		<a href="img/pages/artshow/artshow_05.jpg" data-lightbox="artshowguide" rel="lightbox"><img class="as_prev" src="img/pages/artshow/artshow_05small.jpg" alt="frame" /></a>
		<p class="retain just">That's how it looks like on the panel.</p>
		<span class="divider"></span>
		<a href="img/pages/artshow/artshow_06.jpg" data-lightbox="artshowguide" rel="lightbox"><img class="as_prev" src="img/pages/artshow/artshow_06small.jpg" alt="frame" /></a>
		<p class="retain just">The white pieces of paper on the panel are the bidsheets. Each piece needs a bidsheet. As you 
		can see, they are fairly large (smaller for art that is not for sale though), so you need to 
		include them in your planned layout.</p>    
		<p>Without a bidsheet, your audience cannot bid or buy, so it's sort of important to have them.</p>
		<span class="divider"></span>
		<a href="img/pages/artshow/artshow_07.jpg" data-lightbox="artshowguide" rel="lightbox"><img class="as_prev" src="img/pages/artshow/artshow_07small.jpg" alt="frame" /></a>
		<p class="retain just">Example number one of what not to do. The unfortunate soul that tried to display this exhibit 
		used adhesive tape instead of a proper eye. Of course, the piece fell down and had to be taken 
		out of the show.</p>   
		<p class="retain just">Obviously this is a standing frame, not a hanging frame &mdash; it has no provisions to hang at all. 
		You can use these frames only on a table. Otherwise, you need to screw an eye on the frame. 
		<b class="retain just">Adhesive tape does not work</b>.</p>   
		<p class="retain just">Please note that we cannot fix your frames for you during the show, nor do we have the tools 
		to drill and screw frames.</p>
		<span class="divider"></span>
		<a href="img/pages/artshow/artshow_08.jpg" data-lightbox="artshowguide" rel="lightbox"><img class="as_prev" src="img/pages/artshow/artshow_08small.jpg" alt="frame" /></a>
		<p class="retain just">Example number two of what not to do. Hot-glueing a piece of wire doesn't work either, 
		at least not on wood.</p>  
		<p class="retain just">If you need to work with glue, please test the system at home. Remember, a panel may be 
		rocked or shaken during the show, so "working just so-so" is not good enough. The hanging 
		mechanism must be sturdy enough to survive a certain degree of rough handling.</p>
		<span class="divider"></span>
		<p class="retain just">And that's it! Thank you for your consideration in preparing art for the show, it makes 
		the setup so much smoother and faster if you just need to grab a hook and hang a piece.</p>  
		<p class="retain just">Please consider that while we are in a city, you may not be able to buy a fitting frame 
		on location, especially if you need one for a foreign aspect ratio. Prepare the frame as well 
		as the art. If you come a long way, we do recommend mat frames for easy transport, but be 
		aware of stubbed corners.</p>  
		<p class="retain just">Remember: A clear plastic binder sheet is not a frame! Respect your art, and grace it 
		with a mat frame at least.</p>
