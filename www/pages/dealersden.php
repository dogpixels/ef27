<h1>Dealers’ Den Rules &amp; Information</h1>

<h2>The <i>Short</i> Version</h2>
<section class="uk-column-1-2@l">
	<p>Sales in the Dealers’ Den are only allowed by registered dealers in  authorized dealerships within designated spaces. Sharing space at a dealership with unauthorized dealers is not allowed.</p>
	<p>To be eligible for registration as a dealer or dealer assistant, a previous registration for Eurofurence (the event) is mandatory. After an additional registration on the Dealers’ Den website, a chosen dealership package is added to the dealer’s existing registration for the event.</p>
	<p><strong>Electricity is available for dealerships.</strong> We offer electricity for low-power consumption devices only.</p>
	<p>Dealerships are available in different (table) sizes. During Dealers’ Den registration, the desired size and table configuration can be applied for. Dealership space is limited, and the Dealers’ Den Management will try to accommodate as many artists and dealers as possible without cutting down or denying requested space upon availability. During placement, we will also try to consider requests in regard to location and dealership neighbors.</p>
	<p>Dealership applications will be queued into a curated system; the application will be reviewed by the Dealers’ Den Management, approved or declined, then placed. Payment for dealerships is not due until the dealer has confirmed their assigned dealership size. Placement in the room commences thereafter. The period for application will be approximately one month.</p>
	<p>Any dealerships not initially accepted will be placed on a waiting list. If a dealership space becomes re-available, the next dealer on the waiting list will be contacted. There might be last-minute sales of canceled dealership spaces at the convention itself.</p>
	<p><strong>It is not possible to cancel and refund a dealership package but the dealership package can be transferred from one dealer to another dealer on the waiting list.</strong> Please notify the Dealers’ Den Management about a desired  transfer of a dealership package in a timely manner.</p>
	<p>Dealers will have setup slots on Sunday evening and early Monday to set up and prepare their dealerships. A convention badge is required for Dealers’ Den Check-In; for all dealers and their assistants.</p>
	<p>Teardown begins on Wednesday at 18:00, the dealerships have to be cleared out and the dealers have to check out with the Dealers’ Den Staff no later than 20:00. Each dealer is responsible to clean up their dealership. </p>
	<p>Items and services in violation of applicable rules or laws must not be offered. Adult material is only permissible on public display in the “After Dark” section of the Dealers’ Den. Dealership build-ups must not reach into other dealerships or walkways. Lights, music or sound, and strong smells or fumes must be kept to a minimum.</p>
	<p>Dealers’ Den Staff have a say on all matters. The Dealers’ Den Management’s decisions are final.</p>
	<p>Any person requesting a dealership at Eurofurence is required to agree to and accept the “Dealers’ Den Rules” set in this document. </p>
	<p>If you have any questions after reading the <span class="uk-text-italic">Dealers’ Den Rules & Information</span> and the FAQ, please feel free to email us at dealers@eurofurence.org.</p>

<h2>Glossary and Terms</h2>
<section>
	<div>
		<h3 class="reset-font">Dealer</h3>
		<p>The dealer is the single person ultimately responsible for the dealership and the authority for questions from staff. A dealer can only run one dealership. A dealer needs a valid Eurofurence event registration for the on-site Dealers’ Den Check-In.</p>
	</div>

	<div>
		<h3 class="reset-font">Dealer Assistant</h3>
		<p>Any person working in a dealership needs to be registered as a dealer assistant. A dealer assistant is supporting the dealer, while holding the same access and sales privileges as the respective dealer himself. Dealer assistant status is particularly important during setup and teardown, as only dealers and dealer assistants are granted access into the Dealers’ Den during those times. Dealerships may have multiple dealer assistants, based on the size of the dealership. Each dealer assistant can only be assigned to one dealership, while still being permitted to support other dealerships. Dealer assistants need a valid Eurofurence event registration for the on-site Dealers’ Den Check-In.</p>
	</div>

	<div>
		<h3 class="reset-font">Dealership</h3>
		<p>A dealership consists of one or more tables under the exclusive control of a single dealer, supported by dealer assistants, to display, give away, advertise, offer or sell items, merchandise or services.</p>

<h2>Obtaining a Dealership</h2>
<section class="uk-column-1-2@l">
	<div>
		<h3 class="reset-font">Step I: Application</h3>
		<p>The dealership application period is planned to start in March 2023. It will be open for at least four weeks.</p>
		<p>To be eligible for registration as a dealer or dealer assistant, a previous registration for Eurofurence (the event) via the Eurofurence <a href="https://identity.eurofurence.org" target="_blank">Registration System</a> is mandatory. After registering for the event a dealership application can be submitted on the Dealers’ Den website <a href="https://dealers.eurofurence.org" target="_blank">https://dealers.eurofurence.org</a>. During Dealers’ Den registration, the desired size and table configuration for the dealership can be applied for.</p>
		<p>Dealership applications without valid previous event registration will be canceled.</p>
		<p>After carefully reading, filling out and sending the dealership registration an email confirmation will automatically be sent to confirm our receiving of the application. <strong>This notification is NOT a confirmation for the dealership!</strong></p>
		<p>The Dealers’ Den Management will review submissions after the registration period has ended. Status emails about approval, denial, or being put on the waiting list will be sent after the review. Upon approval, the dealer’s Eurofurence registration will be updated with a dealership package. The package will show up as an extra amount due in the dealer’s  registration. Payment is handled through the Eurofurence Registration website. </p>
		<p>Please note that any and all additional obligations like trade fair and exhibition visa, sales tax or income tax declarations have to be fulfilled by the dealership. Eurofurence expects all dealerships to be fully aware of their responsibilities in accordance with applicable law in Germany as well as their country of origin and will neither assist nor advise on these matters. Please set up an appointment with your nearest German embassy or consulate regarding questions about the application process for a trade fair and exhibition visa / Schengen visa.</p>
	</div>

	<div>
		<h3 class="reset-font">Step II: Approval</h3>
		<p>Dealerships at Eurofurence will be approved on a curated basis.</p>
		<p>Curation will be performed by Dealers’ Den Management. Dealerships will be assigned based on a variety of factors, including, but not limited to:
			<ul>
				<li>Merchandise &ndash; relevance of the offered items and services to the furry fandom and interests of attendees.</li>
				<li>Quality &ndash; assessed quality of the offered item, based on information and photographs from a dealer’s website, prior dealerships of the dealer, and/or additional information.</li>
				<li>Variety &ndash; overall number of different dealerships offering items or services of the same kind.</li>
			</ul>
		</p>
		<p>Dealers may be offered an alternative dealership size depending on availability.</p>
		<p>Dealership applications must be completed in full to be considered. The responsibility for completing an incomplete application solely rests with the respective dealer. Dealers’ Den staff is not responsible to complete any application nor prompted to ascertain any missing information.</p>
		<p>The date of registration neither influences the amount of dealership space nor the chance of any dealership space being allocated to a dealer at all</p>
	</div>

	<div>
		<h3 class="reset-font">Step III: Payment</h3>
		<p>After dealership approval, the dealer’s Eurofurence event registration will be updated to include the fee for the assigned dealership. The dealer is required to pay the fee at the same time as their respective Eurofurence event registration fee, using their preferred payment method.</p>
		<p>Placement of dealerships with fees still due on their Eurofurence registration is not possible. If payment is overdue, Dealers’ Den Management may cancel an application and offer the space to the next dealer on the waiting list.</p>
		<p>Eurofurence e.V. handles all transactions in Euro (€). Fees must be paid via credit or debit cards. Eurofurence e.V. does not accept PayPal, cash payment or any other method of payment. All payments must be handled through the Eurofurence Registration System. Do never send any credit card information via email!</p>
	</div>

	<div>
		<h3 class="reset-font">Step IV: Placement</h3>
		<p>Upon completion of payment, Dealers’ Den Management will commence dealership placement, based on requests and space availability. Although dealership placements are not final until the start of the event, an email containing the preliminary dealership placement will be sent to each dealer for information. Dealers’ Den management is open for any suggestions any dealer may offer about alternative placement.</p>
	</div>

	<div>
		<h3 class="reset-font">Waiting List</h3>
		<p>Any dealerships not initially accepted in Step II will be placed on a waiting list curated under the same factors. Information about this status will also be sent to the respective dealer after Step IV is completed. Changes to the original application (including requests for different dealership sizes) via email reply to the waiting list information might lead to a re-evaluation of the application on the waiting list.</p>
		<p>If a dealership space becomes re-available due to cancellation of another dealer, the first dealer on the waiting list will be contacted. There will be limited time to respond, usually only about a week. Once the dealer has confirmed their newly assigned dealership size, the corresponding dealership package will be added to the dealer’s Eurofurence registration, and the payment will be due immediately.</p>
		<p>There might be last-minute sales of canceled dealership spaces on a first-come, first-serve basis at the convention itself, starting 12:00 (noon) on Monday for unclaimed dealerships.</p>
	</div>

	<div>
		<h3 class="reset-font">Cancellations</h3>
		<p>If a dealer can no longer make use of their dealership, they are asked to contact Dealers’ Den Management via email in a timely manner. <span class="uk-text-italic">Not doing so is considered unfair to dealers who are on the waiting list and will lead to a lower priority during curation on future events for the dealer.</span></p>
		<p><strong>It is not possible to cancel and refund a dealership package but the dealership package can be transferred from one dealer to another dealer on the waiting list.</strong> Please notify the Dealers’ Den Management about a desired  transfer of a dealership package in a timely manner to work out the necessary arrangements.</p>

<h2>Before the Dealers’ Den Opens</h2>
<section>
	<p><strong>Dealers’ Check-In for 2023 will be located in Hall H</strong> - Segment “Arts & Crafts” and opened after the Opening Ceremony on Sunday. Entering the Dealers’ Den without checking in and receiving dealer’s credentials will not be possible.</p>
	<p>Each dealer and their assistant(s) must personally present their official Eurofurence attendee badge at Dealers’ Check-In. A dealer assistant can only be checked in in the presence of the respective dealer.</p>
	<p>Any dealer arriving later than Monday 12:00 is required to contact Dealers’ Den Management to prevent their dealership from being canceled and sold. <strong>Any dealer failing to claim their dealership without informing Dealers’ Den Management in advance will affect their curation priority for future events.</strong></p>
</section>

<hr />

<h2>Dealers’ Den Setup</h2>
<h3 class="reset-font">On Site Dealers’ Check-In</h3>
<section>
	<p>
		<ul>
			<li>Setup for dealers will be possible during the times scheduled. Dealers may use a non-motorized cart to carry in their goods during this time only. Please contact Dealers’ Den Staff in advance if this might pose an issue for you.</li>
			<li>It is not possible to have any items sent to or stored at the CCH in advance of Eurofurence taking place.</li>
			<li>The total height of a dealership, including all build-ups upon, must not exceed two meters.</li>
			<li>All build-ups must be built sturdy and non-yielding, must not be overloaded, or in any other way compromise safety.</li>
			<li>Build-ups must not reach into other dealerships or walkways.</li>
		</ul>
	</p>
	<p>Dealerships and build-ups will constantly be checked by Dealers’ Den Staff to ensure a safe environment for everyone.</p>
</section>

<hr />

<h2>The Dealers’ Den is Open!</h2>
<section class="uk-column-1-2@l">
	<p>Dealers’ Den will open to attendees at the time scheduled in the ConBook. An initial admission period is reserved for Sponsors and Super Sponsors before general admission begins.</p>

	<h3 class="reset-font">Guidelines on Dealerships</h3>
	<p>All dealerships include approximately one meter of space behind them. Each dealership is required to maintain sufficient walking space to enable other dealers to move in and out. Pre-arranged safety paths for exit and emergency evacuation in between dealerships must not be obstructed; merchandise must not reach into these paths. Tables shall not be moved without approval of Dealers’ Den Management.</p>
	<p>Upon request, tables and chairs may be removed from a dealership.</p>
	<p>With the exception of “Half”, all dealership packages can be shared with another authorized dealer. The dealer sharing the dealership is solely responsible for the joint dealership and payment therefore. A potential distribution of costs for the joint dealership between the dealers lies in the responsibility of the dealers involved in the joint dealership.</p>
	<p>Any change of a joint dealership or a dealership of the type “Half” requires the consent of all dealers involved, as well as the notification and approval of the Dealers’ Den Management.</p>
	
	<h3 class="reset-font">Guidelines on Merchandise</h3>
	<p>
		<ul>
			<li>
				Items offered for sale in the Eurofurence Dealers’ Den should be related to the anthropomorphic theme of the convention or should have a broad appeal to furries and others in attendance of Eurofurence.
				<ul>
					<li>Typical items for sale are (badge) commissions, original furry artwork and prints, Digital Media with artwork, furry-themed jewelry and fursuit materials as well as plushies made of faux fur.</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
			<li>
				Any item that is prohibited for sale is also not permitted for display, giveaway, advertisement or delivery. Items generally prohibited for sale include, but are not limited to:
				<ul>
					<li>weapons and weapon look-alikes,</li>
					<li>items and symbols of forbidden organizations according to §86 and §86a of the German Penal Code (StGB) (Nazi symbols and others),</li>
					<li>items with symbols relating to groups associated with the “alt furry” movement,</li>
					<li>items with variations or modifications similar enough to be mistaken for a symbol mentioned above or intentionally obscured renderings of those symbols,</li>
					<li>any kind of drugs and medications,</li>
					<li>items depicting pedophilia or zoophilia,</li>
					<li>items depicting any kind of excessive violence, cruelty or rape.</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
			<li>Items made of real fur or animal body parts, including taxidermy, clothing or accessories are prohibited. Items made from leather are accepted.</li>
			<li>The sale of food and beverages for direct consumption is not allowed anywhere in the Convention Center, including the Dealers’ Den. Consumable items in closed containers can be permitted for sale with explicit (written) permission of the Dealers’ Den Management in individual cases.</li>
			<li>The sale or offering of items that reproduce or otherwise directly imitate third parties’ copyrighted material without explicit, written permission from the copyright holder is strictly forbidden. The responsibility to ensure proper permission for use of copyrighted material rests solely with the Dealer.</li>
		</ul>
	</p>
	<p>If an item or service requires a specific permit or a license for offering or selling the item or service, the Dealer is required to present the permit or license upon request at any time.</p>
	<p>Any item that violates this policy may be banned from display or sale on the sole discretion of the Dealers’ Den Management. Copyrighted items prohibited for sale include, but are not limited to, unlicensed depictions of any characters appearing in any media or counterfeit merchandise of any kind.</p>
	<p>Unlike Common Law countries, the German copyright law does not include a general Fair Use / Fair Dealing exception. Dealers are advised to inform themselves about compliance with European and German copyright law, applicable trademarks, as well as topics like parodies and fan art prior to their attendance. The Eurofurence Dealers’ Den Staff must not give any legal advice on this matter.</p>
	<p>
		<ul>
			<li>Items that were created using any kind of AI based generators are excluded from sale, display, trade or giveaway. This also applies to works (e.g. stories, audio, backgrounds), that are derived from such items.</li>
			<li>No items shall be produced, displayed, given away, advertised, delivered or sold that bear the official “Eurofurence” logo or CI without explicit, written permission of the Board of Directors.</li>
		</ul>
	</p>
	<p>Any item that is deemed inappropriate may be banned from display or sale on the sole discretion of the Dealers’ Den Management or their deputies, namely the Dealers’ Den staff.</p>
	
	<h3 class="reset-font">Guidelines on Sales</h3>
	<p>The Eurofurence Dealers’ Den is separated into a general area which is rated PG-13 (natural nudity without sexual focus) and an “After Dark” section which is considered “Rated R”.</p>
	<p>
		<ul>
			<li>In the general area artwork containing adult material shall either be shielded by sticky notes, stickers, or a similar covering, or ideally should be kept in a clearly-marked binder which shall be kept closed by the Dealer when it is not being viewed by a customer. Binders or portfolios containing uncensored artwork shall be separate from other binders. A tag or divider between material rated PG-13 and material rated “R” is not sufficient. Any censoring of artwork (pixelation, blurring, censorship bars) must be done to the satisfaction of Dealers’ Den Staff. In the “After Dark” area censoring is not needed.</li>
			<li>Artwork or other items rated “R” shall be kept from public view and therefore handed to the customer in an nontransparent packaging that obscures the item completely, such as a bag, envelope, or folder. The customer can use their own packaging.</li>
			<li>Five Senses Rule &ndash; The dealership’s display and merchandise shall not cause discomfort to Attendees or other Dealers in regard to sight, sound, smell, taste, or touch. This specifically concerns bright flashing lights, loudspeakers, and strong scents. Audio needs to be kept at such a volume that it does not disturb Attendees or other Dealers; headphones are recommended if audio is a primary selling point of the dealership. Any presentation that is deemed inappropriate may be interdicted on the sole discretion of the Dealers’ Den Management or their deputies.</li>
		</ul>
	</p>

	<h3 class="reset-font">Guidelines on Activities</h3>
	<p>
		<ul>
			<li>In no event shall Eurofurence e.V. be liable for damages, injuries, breakage, or loss incurred to or caused by any Dealer or Attendee.</li>
			<li>Any action or behavior that causes significant interference with Dealers’ Den operations, excessive discomfort to attendees, staff or other dealers or otherwise endangers people or property is strictly forbidden and may result in permanent suspension of dealer status.</li>
			<li>Time spent at their respective dealership during Dealers’ Den opening hours is on the discretion of the dealer themselves. However, a substantial presence is appreciated.</li>
			<li>Covering the dealership with a tablecloth or similar to protect goods from dirt or dust is recommended outside the official opening hours of the Dealers’ Den. Doing so is entirely on discretion of the dealer.</li>
			<li>Any tablecloth, fabric or other materials used for covering or decoration purposes must comply with the "B1 - schwer entflammbar" (flame retardant) classification or better, in accordance with DIN 4102 or EN 13501-1 B - s1 d0 standards. To prove meeting this class, they must have a certificate, usually printed on the label. <strong>Please note</strong> that applying a flame-retardant spray to otherwise uncertified materials does not make them certified. The treated material (e.g., tablecloth) would need to undergo a <strong>full certification process</strong>, including all necessary tests, to verify its flame-retardant properties and receive such a certification.</li>
			<li>Dealers are responsible for providing proof of certification of any tablecloth, fabric or other materials used for covering or decoration purposes. Proof can be provided in printed or digital form. If a dealer cannot provide sufficient proof of the flame-retardant certification for any material upon request, the material or item has to be removed.</li>
			<li>Tablecloths and/or similar are not provided by Eurofurence.</li>
			<li>Activities that cause dirt or contamination are not allowed.</li>
			<li>Electricity is provided with the sole intent for usage by the Dealer with their own equipment and personal devices. The responsibility to ensure functional and electrical safety of own equipment and devices rests solely with the Dealer. Air compressors, laminators or any other high-power consumption devices, must explicitly be allowed by the Dealers’ Den Management during Setup.</li>
			<li>There is a strict <strong>no smoking</strong> policy in the whole CCH. This also includes vaping.</li>
			<li>Any equipment that produces an open flame or excessive heat is not allowed.</li>
		</ul>
	</p>
	<p>Arising issues about Dealers’ Den operations should be directly addressed with the Dealers’ Den Management on site. Urgent matters of any kind can be addressed to any member of Eurofurence Staff.Members of the press, usually accompanied by a member of the Eurofurence Press Team and Dealers’ Den Management to answer their questions may be present in the Dealers’ Den during opening hours.</p>
